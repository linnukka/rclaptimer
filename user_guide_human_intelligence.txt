RC LAP TIMER - USER GUIDE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. HARDWARE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Plug 1-4 LDR sensors into the RCA connectors.
* Point a light source at each sensor tube using either a strong
  flashlight or a laser pointer.

Before racing, check and adjust the sensor reference if needed.

* Step 1
  Plug in the USB power.

* Step 2
  When the display shows "-HELLO-", press and hold either the UP or
  DOWN button (the two left-side buttons next to each other).

* Step 3
  After a short while, the sensor adjustment display begins cycling
  through sensor voltages.

  Display sequence:
  * UE
  * U1
  * U2
  * U3
  * U4
  * Firmware build number
  (then repeats)

  Voltage meanings:
  * UE  = reference voltage (adjustable via the potentiometer next to
          the RCA connectors)
  * U1- U4 = individual sensor voltages

  Voltage notes:
  * If a sensor reads 0 or 3.3, it is either not connected correctly
    or is receiving too little or too much light.
  * Readings between 0.2 and 2.9 are acceptable.

  Adjustment procedure:
  * Place the car between the light source and the sensor.
  * Adjust the potentiometer so UE reads slightly lower than the
    car-detected value, but higher than the value when the sensor
    sees only the light source.
  * Adjust gently and wait for the next display update cycle before
    making further changes.

* Step 4
  When finished, press the START button (middle button) once to exit
  sensor adjustment mode.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. RUNNING A RACE
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Press the START button.

* The display shows the number of laps to run.
  Example:
  LAP5 4

* After a short delay, the enabled lanes are displayed.
  Example:
  LAHE 1 3
  This means lane sensors 1 and 3 are active.

START LIGHT SEQUENCE

* The display shows a single "8".
* Each second, another "8" is added until five "8"s are displayed.
* After a random delay between 0.2 and 3 seconds, the display turns
  off, signaling the race start.
* Two seconds later, the race timer appears on the display.

LAP DETECTION

* Each time a car passes a sensor, the display shows lane number,
  lap number, and elapsed time.

  Examples:
  1.2 00.12.2   = lane 1, lap 2, time 12.2 seconds
  3.7 32.12.3   = lane 3, lap 7, time 32 minutes 12.3 seconds

  Format:
  <lane#>.<lap#> MM:SS.t

FINISH

* When the target lap count is reached, the lap number is replaced
  with "F".

  Example:
  2.F 13.02.6   = lane 2 finished in 13 minutes 2.6 seconds

RACE RESULTS

* When all active lanes have finished, race mode ends.
* Results are displayed in order: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (if used).
* The display shows finishing position, lane number, and total time.

  Example:
  1.4 41.23.2
  2.1 44.23.2

  This means lane 4 won with a time of 41 minutes 23.2 seconds, and
  lane 1 finished second one minute later.

  Format:
  <rank>.<lane#> MM:SS.t

STARTING A NEW RACE

* A new race can be started any time after the start light sequence
  finishes, either while the race clock is running or while results
  are displayed.

CHANGING THE LAP COUNT

* Press START to display the lap count (e.g. LAP5 4).
* While the lap count is shown, use the UP/DOWN buttons to change it.
* Press START to save the new value.
* Press START again to begin the race sequence.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE: Lanes never enable

* Check stop input voltages using diagnostic mode.
* If voltages remain below
  SILENT_LANES_BELOW_MV_ON_RACE_START (0.1 V)
  or above
  SILENT_LANES_ABOVE_MV_ON_RACE_START (3 V),
  the firmware considers the lane unplugged.

ISSUE: Display shows gibberish after long races

* Ensure lap counts remain between 1 and 99.
* Ensure total race duration stays under 100 minutes.
* Values outside these limits exceed the display capacity.


That’s it.
You’re ready to have fun with the RC Lap Timer.
